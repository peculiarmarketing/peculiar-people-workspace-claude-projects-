# Schema Standards

Every section and block must include a `{% schema %}` tag with valid JSON structure.

**Schemas are written inline**, inside the `{% schema %}` tag in the section or
block's own `.liquid` file. This theme has no `schemas/` directory and no
`npm run build:schemas` step — earlier versions of this rule described one, but
neither exists here. Do not look for them and do not create them.

## Required settings on every section

A section schema is not complete without these. The full pattern, including the
matching `{%- style -%}` block and the one permitted exception, is in
`sections.md` — this is the schema-side summary:

| Setting | Type | Label |
|---|---|---|
| `color_scheme` | `color_scheme` | `t:sections.all.colors.label` |
| `padding_top` | `range` 0–100, step 4, default 40 | `t:sections.all.padding.padding_top` |
| `padding_bottom` | `range` 0–100, step 4, default 40 | `t:sections.all.padding.padding_bottom` |
| `padding_top_mobile` | `range` 0–100, step 4, default 40 | `t:sections.all.padding.padding_top_mobile` |
| `padding_bottom_mobile` | `range` 0–100, step 4, default 40 | `t:sections.all.padding.padding_bottom_mobile` |

Plus a `presets` array — without one, a merchant cannot add the section in the
theme editor at all.

All four padding settings are unconditional; the mobile pair is its own value,
not a multiple of the desktop one (ruled 2026-09-17, see `sections.md`).
`color_scheme` may be omitted only with a Liquid comment explaining why, per
`sections.md`.

## Labels must be translation keys

Every `label`, `content`, `info`, and preset `name` uses a `t:` key resolving in
`locales/en.default.schema.json`. Never a bare English string.

```json
{ "type": "range", "id": "padding_top", "label": "t:sections.all.padding.padding_top" }
```

not

```json
{ "type": "range", "id": "padding_top", "label": "Padding Top" }
```

Some existing Base sections use bare English labels for padding. Those predate
this rule; match the `t:` form above, not them.

## `name` is capped at 25 characters

Theme Check's `ValidSchemaName` fails a schema whose `name` exceeds 25
characters. It is a hard limit, it is not obvious from the error, and it is
easy to hit with a descriptive name:

```json
"name": "Complete Your Stack Drawer"   // 26 — fails
"name": "Complete Your Stack"          // 19 — fine
```

The limit is on `name` only. Preset names, labels and headings are unaffected —
put the longer wording in the preset name, which is what a merchant actually
reads in the theme editor:

```json
{
  "name": "Quick Shop",
  "presets": [{ "name": "t:sections.quick_shop.preset_name" }]
}
```

Count it before you commit; the pre-commit Theme Check will otherwise tell you
at the worst moment.

## Blocks are capped at 50; settings are not

A section may define at most **50 blocks**. `max_blocks` lowers that ceiling; it
cannot raise it. Exceeding it is a real deploy failure.

There is **no documented maximum on the `settings` array**. A section with sixty
settings is hard to use and probably wants splitting, but it is a usability
judgement, not a validation or deploy risk, and must never be reported as one.

The distinction matters because the two are easy to conflate. A wrongly claimed
limit sends someone chasing a failure that cannot happen, and they lose more time
proving it is fine than they would have spent on a real defect.

## Setting Types and Usage

### Input settings

These are the bulk of the settings with which the merchant will interact.

See [input settings documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings)

### Sidebar settings

These are informative settings to guide the merchant.

See [sidebar settings documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/settings/sidebar-settings)


## Best practices

### Label Guidelines

- Keep labels concise (under 30 characters)
- Setting type provides context - "Columns" not "Number of columns"
- No verb-based labels for checkboxes
- Use title case: "Show Vendor" not "show vendor"


### Setting Organization Rules

**1. Resource Pickers First**
- Collection, product, blog, page pickers come first
- These are required for section functionality

**2. Visual Impact Order**
- Layout settings (columns, spacing)
- Typography settings (fonts, sizes)
- Color settings (background, text)
- Padding/margin last

**3. Group settings using Headers**
```json
{
  "type": "header",
  "content": "Layout"
}
```
